# 🚀 Interactive Apple Ecosystem Web Portfolio
### Real-Time macOS & iOS Operating System Portfolio (React + Tailwind + Framer Motion)

An interactive, web-based operating system simulation that presents a developer portfolio through a dual-interface experience—featuring a full **macOS Desktop workspace** for desktop views and an authentic **iOS iPhone simulator** with hardware bezels for mobile screens.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project reimagines the classic portfolio website by turning it into a living, tactile operating system. Visitors can drag and resize desktop windows, launch apps, interact with a dynamic top status bar, check real-time system battery metrics, and switch between macOS and iOS views depending on their screen size.
